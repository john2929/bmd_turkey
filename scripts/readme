In-feed bacitracin methylene disalicylate modulates the turkey microbiota and metabolome in a dose-dependent manner

by TA Johnson et al.

The script BMD_16S_analysis.Rmd completes the following analyses for the 16S amplicon dataset:
  1. Alpha diversity statistical comparisons and graphics
  2. Beta diversity calculation, statistics (PERMANOVA), and graphics
  3. Graphical representation of the composition of the jejunal, ileal and cecal microbial communities in stacked bar plots.
  
  
The script BMD_metabolome_analysis.Rmd completes the following analyses for the metabolome dataset:
  1. Beta diversity calculation, statistics (PERMANOVA), and graphics
  2. Count of differentially present metabolites due to BMD treatment grouped by both major and sub nutrient families
  

The script randomForest_metabolome.R completes the following analyses for the metabolome dataset:
  1. Calculation and graphical representation of distinguishing metabolites in pairwise comparisons 
     between time-matched BMD treatment groups
  2. Compilation of the most distinguishing metabolites in all comparisons in a single graphical output.
